Somebody asked:
Have you written poems for your homeland?
The earth shook, my fingers were still.
Will grief-pressed weighted shoulders
move from mountain to mountain?

Could Homeland be strong tea
That quenches thirst and gives pleasure?
Could Homeland be the narrow path
Whose trees give shade yet
When barred is desert wilderness?
